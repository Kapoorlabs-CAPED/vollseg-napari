VollSeg is more than just a single segmentation algorithm; it is a meticulously designed modular segmentation tool tailored to diverse model organisms and imaging methods. While a U-Net might suffice for certain image samples, others might benefit from utilizing StarDist, and some could require a blend of both, potentially coupled with denoising or region of interest models. The pivotal decision left to make is how to select the most appropriate VollSeg configuration for your dataset, a question we comprehensively address in our [documentation website](https://kapoorlabs-caped.github.io/vollseg-napari/).

This project provides the [napari](https://napari.org/) plugin for [VollSeg](https://github.com/kapoorlab/vollseg), a deep learning based 2D and 3D segmentation tool for irregular shaped cells. VollSeg has originally been developed (see [papers](http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2021/varun_kapoor.html)) for the segmentation of densely packed membrane labelled cells in challenging images with low signal-to-noise ratios. The plugin allows to apply pretrained and custom trained models from within napari.
For detailed demo of the plugin see these [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_gKrLWKNpQ) and a short video about the [parameter selection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tQMn_u8_7s&t=1s) 


## Installation & Usage

Install the plugin with `pip install vollseg-napari` or from within napari via `Plugins > Install/Uninstall Package(s)â€¦`. 

You can activate the plugin in napari via `Plugins > VollSeg: VollSeg`. Example images for testing are provided via `File > Open Sample > VollSeg`.

If you use this plugin for your research, please [cite us](http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2021/varun_kapoor.html).


## Examples

VollSeg comes with different options to combine CARE based denoising with UNET, StarDist and segmentation in a region of interest (ROI). We present some examples which are represent optimal combination of these different modes for segmenting different cell types. We summarize this in the table below:
| Example Image | Description | Training Data | Trained Model |
| --- | --- |--- | --- |
| ![Raw Ascadian Embryo](images/Ascadian_raw.png)| Light sheet fused from four angles 3D single channel| [Training Data ~320 GB](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Astec-half-Pm1_Cut_at_2-cell_stage_half_Phallusia_mammillata_embryo_live_SPIM_imaging_stages_6-16_/11309570?backTo=/s/765d4361d1b073beedd5)| [UNET model](https://zenodo.org/record/6337699) |
